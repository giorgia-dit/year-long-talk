# A one-year-long talk

### How to replay the visualizations
1. Download from your WhatsApp application a chat (only tested for 2-people chats) in `.txt` format and save it to the `chat/` folder.
2. Open `constants.py` and insert the name string of the `txt` file, **without** the extension. Also add an export name for the dataset.
3. Run `main.py`.
4. Open `script.R` and run it.
5. When asked to input a file, choose the dataset exported from Python.
6. The visualizations will be saved in the viz folder.
